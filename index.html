                <p class="image-caption">The beautiful garden of our hostel on a sunny day, perfect for a quick nap.</p>
                <p class="cursive-text">We stayed at a beautiful carefully decorated hostel, with a big green garden and a local pet dog called Taxi. Our home was a Utopia, a safe space, a haven. And outside our heavenly hostel, lurked the cold hearted, mysterious passages of Leipzig city. After a few hours of pondering, I overcame my fear of the unknown and decided to leave my beautiful bubble and before I knew it, I had become part of many who roam the streets in silence. And it was fun, it was fine and it became a new habit of mine; to go solo, leave at night or during the day and explore my new home. But there was one obstacle:</p>
                <img src="./images/Why so much doodoo.png" alt="Why so much doodoo.png" class="resized-image">
                <p class="image-caption">Doodoo on every damn corner.</p>
                <p class="cursive-text"> I wondered why this was the case. Are the dogs okay? Is there a repeat offender?
                    Is it a dog? Is there something in the water? Are the people angry about something?
                Is this a form of protest? Lead by dogs or humans? I was in my thoughts for 
            days, walking on more than just eggshells, watching every corner I turned. 
        And then one day; I found the answer: so simple yet so key:    </p>

        <p class="cursive-text">Trash cans. I was feeding my daily Nikotinabusus and 
            noticed that there was no home for used cigarettes. No bins no nothing. 
            There are trash cans, the ones with the wheels; that are often parked outside
            Apartments. But once you're out in the open, on offical street-territory, the 
            bins disappear.  </p>

            <p class="cursive-text"> That, I assumed is the main cause for this
                dilemma, human laziness and incompitence of some set aside. And that is 
                when i realized; Leipziger dogs and dog owners
            aren't as ruthless as we think: at the end
            of the day. Like us; who have no choice but to grow and age in Braunschweig,
             they are just victims of their circumstances, trying to make ends meet. </p>

                    <p>We visited multiple museums hoping to expand our art
                    pallette. The one that struck me the most was the 
                    Museum of fine arts. It was a very modern 
                    and elegant place. I climbed the bulky stairs and explored all 
                    three floors. I sketched, walked and looked around. The 
                    majority of art that they had on show was antiquated art. 
                    Looking at my sketches, I'm definite that I was inspired and 
                    attracted to specific pieces with a similiar theme; human vulnerability and
                    pain. I mainly sketched what I saw and free-styled the last two sketches
                    from memory.

                        <p> One of our tasks also involved walking around the 
                            innercity area and documenting/ playing with what we
                            see. I decided to focus on specific Elements; shapes 
                            and lines and marking shadow and light, with 
                            a thick marker, conditioning me to simplify what I see.

                                <p> I took some notes on a video performance 
                              on what I thought the piece represents/ what the
                              statement is, before reading the explanation. 
                              I played used graphics to help me remember and 
                              key sentences and words, which I could break down later.
